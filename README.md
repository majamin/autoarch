# Purpose

These are dotfiles that are the most compatible with Arch-based linux installs.
There are enough objects in here to break your system if you blindly clone this into your home directory, so be careful.

# Installing

To get the nicest experience, get up and going using my fork of [LARBS](https://github.com/majamin/LARBS) (all credit to [LS](https://lukesmith.xyz/)).

If you don't want to do this, then I'm assuming that you know what you're doing with dotfiles.
