== Formatting text

[.lead]
This text will be styled as a lead paragraph (i.e., larger font).

It has *strong* significance to me.

I _cannot_ stress this enough.

Type `OK` to accept.

That *_really_* has to go.

Can't pick one? Let's use them `*_all_*`.

**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete (CRUD)

That's fan__freakin__tastic!

Don't pass generic ``Object``s to methods that accept ``String``s!

It was Beatle**__mania__**!

Werewolves are allergic to #cinnamon#.

##Mark##up refers to text that contains formatting ##mark##s.

Where did all the [.underline]#cores# go?

We need [.line-through]#ten# twenty VMs.

A [.myrole]#custom role# must be fulfilled by the theme.

^super^script phrase

~sub~script phrase

"`double curved quotes`"

'`single curved quotes`'

Olaf's desk was a mess.

A ``std::vector```'s size is the number of items it contains.

All of the werewolves`' desks were a mess.

Olaf had been with the company since the `'00s.
